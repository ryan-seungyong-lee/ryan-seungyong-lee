Hi, I’m SeungYong Lee, an AI research engineer with a passion for building practical systems across **computer vision**, **generative AI**, and **scalable infrastructure**. As a **founding member of an AI startup (NXN LABS)**, I’ve led full-stack development for production-level AI—from raw data collection and model design to large-scale training, deployment, and monitoring.

Educated in mathematics and electrical engineering at KAIST, I’ve built a strong foundation for tackling complex problems in AI. Through hands-on work across research labs, AI startups, and industry settings, I’ve developed and deployed systems that bridge state-of-the-art models with real-world applications.

My work spans the full stack—from designing novel model architectures and scaling multi-node training, to deploying optimized inference pipelines for AI services. Lately, I’ve been exploring **test-time scaling strategies** for **high-quality, controllable, and efficient image generation** and **Multimodal AI** for **agent-based systems**.

## 🌟 Projects

### 👕 Virtual Try-On Platform — *NXN LABS*
As a founding member of **NXN LABS**, I led the end-to-end development of a virtual try-on system for fashion.

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6bcd15e-d751-4f0f-aec0-7e83f3781704)

- Built complete **data pipeline**: web crawling → pre-processing → human validation → DB structuring.
- Designed generative architecture using **DiT + Flow Matching**, tailored for fine-grained control.
- Trained on **HPC clusters** using **DeepSpeed + FSDP**, monitored with **Weights & Biases**.
- Evaluated with benchmark scenarios (user-level fidelity, inference time).
- Deployed full-stack: **FastAPI backend**, optimized inference pipeline, and user-facing UI.

> 📌 A full-stack generative AI system, from raw data to real-time try-on experiences.
