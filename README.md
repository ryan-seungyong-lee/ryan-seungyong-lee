Hi, I’m SeungYong Lee, an AI research engineer with a passion for building practical systems across **computer vision**, **generative AI**, and **scalable infrastructure**. As a **founding member of an AI startup (NXN LABS)**, I’ve led full-stack development for production-level AI—from raw data collection and model design to large-scale training, deployment, and monitoring.

Educated in mathematics and electrical engineering at KAIST, I’ve built a strong foundation for tackling complex problems in AI. Through hands-on work across research labs, AI startups, and industry settings, I’ve developed and deployed systems that bridge state-of-the-art models with real-world applications.

My work spans the full stack—from designing novel model architectures and scaling multi-node training, to deploying optimized inference pipelines for AI services. Lately, I’ve been exploring **test-time scaling strategies** for **high-quality, controllable, and efficient image generation** and **Multimodal AI** for **agent-based systems**.

## Projects

### Virtual Try-On Platform — *NXN LABS*
As a founding member of **NXN LABS**, I led the end-to-end development of a virtual try-on system for fashion.

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6bcd15e-d751-4f0f-aec0-7e83f3781704)

- Built complete **data pipeline**: web crawling → pre-processing → human validation → DB structuring.
- Designed generative architecture using **DiT + Flow Matching**, tailored for fine-grained control.
- Trained on **HPC clusters** using **DeepSpeed + FSDP**, monitored with **Weights & Biases**.
- Evaluated with benchmark scenarios (user-level fidelity, inference time).
- Deployed full-stack: **FastAPI backend**, optimized inference pipeline, and user-facing UI.

> A full-stack generative AI system, from raw data to real-time try-on experiences.

### Virtual Human Generation — *NXN LABS*
Built controllable and consistent virtual humans using 3D modeling and image generation.

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6e04d9b-5b21-4653-80f0-1d6cf0cbcfee)

- Used **SMPL** and **HMR** to map human mesh from 2D inputs.
- Controlled pose/viewpoint in **Blender**, rendering synthetic 3D conditions.
- Generated images using **Stable Diffusion**, with **LoRA, ControlNet, Adapter** extensions.
- Rapid prototyping with **ComfyUI**, streamlining model and prompt iterations.

> Bridging geometry-based modeling and diffusion-based generation for controllable virtual avatars.

### Pathology Image Detection — *Lunit (Oncology Dept.)*
Contributed as a research scientist intern to improve cancer detection with transformer architectures.

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a80d37dd-78bc-4320-b232-64469fc517f6)

- Introduced **ViT-based backbones** to replace CNNs, achieving significant accuracy improvements.
- Designed **Multi-FoV Transformer** for better contextual field integration.
- Migrated framework from heatmap detection to **DETR-style regression**, improving mF1 by **+4.5**.
- Built entire experimental pipeline: **data loader, loss functions, evaluation metrics, visualization tools**.

> Demonstrated performance gains of vision transformers in medical image analysis with clinical impact.
